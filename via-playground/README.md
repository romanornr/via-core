# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a
Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

1. Duplicate the `example.env` and create a `.env` file
2.

```shell
source .env
via verifier deposit --amount 100 --receiver-l2-address 0x36615Cf349d7F6344891B1e7CA7C72883F5dc049
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network via
```
